\section{Input Circuit}
For the input supply I am going to use a transformator 2x18V at 1.5A, that I already have. I am going to connect the 18V's in series to get 36V at 1.5A.
The 36 volt ac are going to be converted to dc, via fullwave diode bridge. Sinces the ac voltage specified on the transformer is RMS voltage, an not the peak voltage. We can calculate what the dc voltage will become assuming no losses.
\begin{align} \label{eq:calc_vdc}
V_{ dc } &= \frac{ 2 \cdot V_{ max } }{ \pi } \\
         &= 0.637 \cdot V_{ max } \\
         &= 0.9 \cdot V_{ RMS } \\
         &= 0.9 \cdot 36 V_{ac} \nonumber \\
         &= 32.4 V_{ dc } \nonumber
\end{align}
But since we are going to use a bridge rectifier there is two times diode voltage drop that gives total drop of \(1.4V\). Which meaning that we are properly only going to see around \( 31V \) if measure the diode bridge output. And the 50Hz frequency is being doubled to 100Hz.

\subsection{Ripple voltage}

\begin{align}\label{eq:calc_vripple}
V_{ ripple } = \frac{ I_{ load } }{ f \times C } [V]
\end{align}
